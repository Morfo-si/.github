[Mórfo̱si̱](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/μόρφωση) is Greek for education, erudition, learning. As I continue my personal learning journey of technologies, processes, tools, etc, I plan to add any code repository I create here. 

In other words, this organization will be used as a compendium for all pet projects I create along my personal Continuous Learning journey.
